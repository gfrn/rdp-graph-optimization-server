Backend optimization that utilizes [Ramer-Douglas-Peucker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramer%E2%80%93Douglas%E2%80%93Peucker_algorithm) algorithm for line simplification. Requires [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) for list access optimization, [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) for server-client operation handling and [Shapely](https://pypi.org/project/Shapely/) for their implementation of RDP, as anything running purely in Python would be incredibly slow.
